# GitHub API
This project involves using the GitHub API to fetch repositories and displaying them in a list. Upon clicking on a particular repository, the application fetches additional details such as the number of stars, forks, and contributors. This project provides a hands-on experience with working with APIs and implementing basic functionality in a web application.
